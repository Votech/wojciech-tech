            My name is Semih, and Iâ€™m a digital designer from the Netherlands. I
            am currently working at Amsterdam-based design agency Unc Inc
            creating digital experiences for brands that want to make the world
            more sustainable.
            <br />
            <br />
            By designing accessible interfaces, I make digital products usable
            for everyone.
            <br />
            <br />
            In my spare time, I write about design and help other designers
            improve their skills by sharing UI & UX related insights. Besides
            that, I enjoy some deep sci-fi movies (Interstellar is my all-time
            favorite), good music, and some quality time with my newborn son.
